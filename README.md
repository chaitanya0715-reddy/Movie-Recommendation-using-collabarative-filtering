Movie Recommendation System

Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on user preferences using a collaborative filtering approach. It leverages user interactions and ratings to generate personalized recommendations. The system is designed to help users discover new movies based on similar audience preferences.

 Features
- Personalized Recommendations: Uses collaborative filtering to suggest movies based on user preferences.
- User-Based & Item-Based Filtering: Implements different approaches to provide recommendations.
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilizes ML techniques for efficient predictions.
- Interactive UI: (If implemented) Uses Gradio to provide an easy-to-use interface for recommendations.
- Scalability: Can be extended with additional filtering techniques such as content-based filtering.

Usage
1. Open the notebook `movie recommendation using collaborative system.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the step-by-step execution of the notebook:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Perform data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, etc.).
   - Train the recommendation model using collaborative filtering.
   - Input a movie name to get recommendations based on similar users' preferences.
3. If an interactive UI is available, run the script to launch the Gradio interface and input a movie name for recommendations.

 Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language.
- Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.
- Scikit-Learn: Implements machine learning algorithms for collaborative filtering.
- Surprise Library: Specialized for recommendation systems.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Gradio: (If implemented) For creating an interactive user interface.

Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing movie ratings and user interactions. The dataset consists of:
- **Movie IDs**: Unique identifiers for movies.
- **User IDs**: Unique identifiers for users.
- **Ratings**: User ratings for different movies.
- **Timestamps**: When the ratings were given (if applicable).

Example Dataset Sources
- MovieLens Dataset: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
- IMDb Movie Ratings

Ensure the dataset is properly formatted before running the notebook.
